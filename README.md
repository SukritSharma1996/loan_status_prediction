# loan_status_prediction
By leveraging historical loan data and utilising the powerful SVM algorithm, this project seeks to provide financial institutions with an accurate and efficient tool for assessing creditworthiness.


Methodology:  
a. Data Collection: Gather historical loan data including applicant information, credit scores, loan amounts, employment details, and previous loan statuses.


b. Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data, handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and encode categorical variables.
c. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features through exploratory data analysis and statistical techniques to improve model performance and reduce dimensionality.


d. Model Development: Implement the SVM algorithm to train a classification model using the preprocessed dataset.


e. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the SVM model using appropriate evaluation metrics and compare it with other classification algorithms.
